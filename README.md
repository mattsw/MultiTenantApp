# Multi tenant app scope

This project will be used to showcase feature management with multiple tenants. This service will be driven by three distinct UI approaches: Angular, Blazor, and React. I will power the data fed to the UI via dotnetcore web api.

# Goals
- Elementary user auth to control feature access
- In memory database ( though this may end up being a persistent solution as implementation dictates )
- Angular driven UI
- React driven UI
- Blazor driven UI
- At least two fabricated features: Cashflow and Dataflow
